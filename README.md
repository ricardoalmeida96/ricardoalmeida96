// Our society requires us to follow a specific academic standard. 🤓

// However, I have always been curious to know how things work in the most diverse areas. 🌍

// This ideology led me, and still leads me today, to know more perspectives, more work methodologies and many other soft skills that surely helped to build the person I am today. 💯

// Programming is the most recent discovery in this long path that we call a professional career and it has challenged me immensely at many levels. 💻

// I hope to learn more and persist all this new knowledge for something that makes the difference. ✔️

// For more information, I am always willing to have a coffee or a good glass of whisky. 🥃

// Or simply an online meeting due to the world pandemic crisis. 😷
